<body><div><h1>Simple HTML & CCS Page</h1><br />My Name is Louie Qura this is my second semester at csm. I graduated from burlingame high school, class of 2020. I am a very active person and enjoy playing compettive sports. I played varsity soccer in highschool. I enjoy spending time with family and friends but I also like to spend time alone. I don not have much experience in computer science but hopfully by the end of the semester I will be great at it.<br /> <img src="picture2.jpeg" />I am attending this class because I want to gain experience and learn about web design and possibly later in the future have a carrer in it. </div>
